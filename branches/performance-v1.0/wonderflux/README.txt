IMPORTANT!!

You have downloaded a DEVELOPMENT BRANCH of Wonderflux - this is purely for development 
and testing of cache and performance coding and SHOULD NOT be used on a live site!

It is our playground for experiments on making Wonderflux work smarter and better.

Once testing has been completed this will be merged into the main 'Trunk' development code
